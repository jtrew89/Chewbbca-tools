# Chewbbca-tools

Set of scripts to run ChewBBACE AlleleCall on the enterobase 3002 cgMLST schema.
Upon finishing the allele call, it will output a list of novel alleles and STs (and 
the isolates they were derived from) from the run, as well as update the profiles.list 
schema with any new STs. These will be marker by '_'.
